# Hotel Booking Invoice System

## Overview
This is a simple, working invoice system for hotel bookings that displays booking data and allows PDF downloads.

## What Was Fixed

### The Problem
Previously, the invoice system was only showing customer data but not the actual booking/room data (like suite data and room data). This happened because:

1. **Missing Event Listener**: The "CONFIRM BOOKING" button in `booking.html` had no event listener to save booking data
2. **No Data Saving**: When users clicked "CONFIRM BOOKING", no booking data was being saved to localStorage
3. **Empty Invoice Table**: The confirmation page tried to read booking data that was never saved

### The Solution
✅ **Added Booking Confirmation Handler**: Now when "CONFIRM BOOKING" is clicked, all booking data is properly saved to localStorage
✅ **Complete Data Saving**: Both booking details (rooms, dates, amounts) and customer information are saved
✅ **Automatic Redirect**: After saving data, users are automatically redirected to the confirmation page
✅ **Data Persistence**: Booking data persists across page navigation and browser refreshes

## How It Works

### 1. Booking Flow
1. User completes booking on `booking.html`
2. When "CONFIRM BOOKING" is clicked, booking data is saved to localStorage
3. User is redirected to `confirmation.html`
4. Invoice automatically loads and displays booking data
5. User can download PDF invoice

### 2. Data Storage
- **Booking Data**: Stored in `localStorage.hotelBookingData`
- **Customer Data**: Stored in `localStorage.customerFullName`, `customerEmail`, etc.
- **Data persists** across page navigation and browser refreshes

## Files

### Core Files
- `confirmation.html` - Invoice display page
- `js/confirmation.js` - Invoice rendering logic
- `booking.html` - Booking form (existing)
- `js/booking.js` - Booking logic (existing)

### Test Files
- `test-booking-flow.html` - Test the complete booking flow
- `test-invoice.html` - Test invoice scenarios

## Testing the System

### Complete Booking Flow Test (Recommended)
1. Open `debug-invoice.html` for diagnosis and testing
2. Click "Open Booking Page" to go to `booking.html`
3. Fill in all booking details and personal information
4. Click the **"CONFIRM BOOKING"** button
5. You'll be automatically redirected to `confirmation.html`
6. Invoice displays with all booking data
7. Test PDF download with "Download Invoice" button

### Quick Test (For Development)
1. Open `test-booking-flow.html`
2. Click "Simulate Booking Confirmation"
3. Click "Open Invoice Page"
4. View the invoice and test PDF download

### Debug Test
1. Open `debug-invoice.html`
2. Use the step-by-step diagnosis tools
3. Load test data and verify invoice rendering
4. Check browser console for detailed logs
